# Pokemon
Very simple version of a Pokemon battle. Currently, the user can select any of the original 151 Pokemon and battle against a computer. 
The code is very simple so there is no typing advantages or different moves a Pokemon can use. 

To run a battle, the main method is in the PokemonBattle.java file 

Code is not completely finished because school started. I will need to finish the code during breaks or free time. 
However, the code will still run and battle properly. 
Still need to fix redundancies, style errors, bugs, and need to add comments.
